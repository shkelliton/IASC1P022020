CSS NOTES
does not have to be separated like this, just style pref
ruleName{
  -modifierCodeOne;
  -modifierCodeTwo;
}
example
h1{font-size:2px;}
-h1 = selector
-font-size = property
-2px = value
font-size: 2px; =  a statement
h1{font-size:2px;} = a rule

Types of CSS classes
any definition contained in {} in your style sheet is a classes
1- modifying existing html elements (start with class to be modified, i.e. body or p)
2 - Custom styled classes that are applied to html elements (starting with .)
3 - Custom styled unique IDs that are applied to unique HTML element(s)(starting with #)
- ID's are supposed to be unique and used once per Page

Styling HTML elements
Modify all existing html elements (start with class to be modified(body or p))
We can modify and HTML structural or content element by just referencing it in our css
blah blah

Calling style definiti
In order to use the custom styles we've generated in CSS we have to call the class or ID from HTML
The attribute class and/or ID are added to our HTML
<p class="myStyle"> Some styled text</p>
<p id="unique"> Some different text</p>
class is used to style items that  appear many times
Id is used to style items that only appear once per page
Class - ".blak"
ID - "#blak"

Class is a barcode, ID is a serial number

declare doctype - xhtml
basic rules - element and attributes must be lowercase
all elements must be closed
attribute values must be in quotes(double or single)
proper nesting is a must
attribute - i.e. font color red

3 types of doctype
strict, transitional, and frameset
transitional is what we use

basic structure

open html

(<html>)
  (<head>)
    header items
    <title> - title is required
    <meta> - how the page is encoded and its language
      - required meta data
        - the language you are using
        - how your page is encoded
      - optional meta data
        - keywords
        - Page description
    <style> - what css files you will be using
    <script> - any scripts you will be using (i.e javascript)
  (</head>)

  (<body>)
    body items
     - content elements
     - structure elements
  (</body>)
(</html)

close html

CSS NOTES
does not have to be separated like this, just style pref
ruleName{
  -modifierCodeOne;
  -modifierCodeTwo;
}
example
h1{font-size:2px;}
-h1 = selector
-font-size = property
-2px = value
font-size: 2px; =  a statement
h1{font-size:2px;} = a rule

Types of CSS classes
any definition contained in {} in your style sheet is a classes
1- modifying existing html elements (start with class to be modified, i.e. body or p)
2 - Custom styled classes that are applied to html elements (starting with .)
3 - Custom styled unique IDs that are applied to unique HTML element(s)(starting with #)
- ID's are supposed to be unique and used once per Page

Styling HTML elements
Modify all existing html elements (start with class to be modified(body or p))
We can modify and HTML structural or content element by just referencing it in our css
blah blah

Calling style definiti
In order to use the custom styles we've generated in CSS we have to call the class or ID from HTML
The attribute class and/or ID are added to our HTML
<p class="myStyle"> Some styled text</p>
<p id="unique"> Some different text</p>
class is used to style items that  appear many times
Id is used to style items that only appear once per page
Class - ".blak"
ID - "#blak"

Class is a barcode, ID is a serial number

selectors
items to style
Do proper nesting, open and close tags appropriately
heirarchy - if one element contains another, it is considered to be a parent of that items
the item that is contained is the child element of the parent
any elements contained in the child element are considered to be descendants of original parent

nested selectors
target styles
- see slides
-element.class selectors
element.class{p.myStyle{etc}}

general sibling selectors
h1~p{color:red;}

any children of h1 will be red
immediate sibling selector
p+p etc

We can have multiple statements for each css rules
if you ever have a duplicate kind of rule the final rule's style will win out

Specificity
Sometimes with lots of css rules you may have a situation where .... see slides
other

The concept that describes the order that CSS rules are executed is Specificity
Basic rules
Order of Specificity
Inline>ID>Class>Element
Whichever is most specific wins out

Math slide - week 4 - points per Specificity

ID = 100
Class = 10
Element = 1

structure

thinking in blocks and percentages
The DIV tag -block level (break before and after)
span is Inline, no newline before or after(no breaks)

<div class="myDiv">Content here</div>
<span class="large">Content here</span>

When to use Div and span

Box Model for CSS

Margin, border, padding, Content
Div built to contain block level content
<div class=box>
  <p>this content</p>
</div>

Margin
Spacing between other things and Border
Can set top, right, bottom, and left
.box{
margin:20px 10% 20px 10%;
}

CSS Borders
Used to wrap a visual division around your Content
Borders can have a color, width, and style. Used in last week lab
border: etc

Padding
Space between margin and content, very similar to margin
padding:
